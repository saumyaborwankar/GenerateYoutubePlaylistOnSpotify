# GenerateYoutubePlaylistOnSpotify
In this project I have used various APIs to gather data and send requests. Youtube API for gathering data of liked videos and then Spotify API for creating playlists and adding songs to it.
To use this project you have to create a spotify account and then take a token key from the protify api developer page and secondly enable youtube API which might be tough but you'll get it in no time. After youre done with this you just have to enter the spotify id (which you will get in the account section of spotify) and the spotify token in the final.py file and just run it, It will automatically make a new playlist called "YT Playlist" in your spotify playlist with all the liked music videos in youtube.
